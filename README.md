UsingTestMediators
==================

Mocks and Mocking are a solution to a certain class of problems. The problems Mocking solves are valid and important. However, I don't believe the way we achieve these solutions (via Mocking) is the correct solution. In other words the means to the end is what I have a problem with. TestMediators solve the same problem as Mocks, but the way we get there (to the solution) is very different and I prefer using TestMediators to Mocking as a result. The project here provides samples code for a simple system and a couple of unit tests that use a TestMediator.
